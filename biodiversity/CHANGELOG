4.0.2 -- add MS Windows libraries

4.0.1 -- fix for simple output

4.0.0 -- migrate code to gnparser C-shared library. This change breaks
         backward compatibility, and makes parser dramatically faster.

3.5.1 -- allow comma before 'and' or '&' in authorship

3.5.0 -- add the tail cut by preprocessing to the results. The tail usually
         contains annotations about the name.

3.4.6 -- gems update.

3.4.5 -- fix "fil." and "filius" with infraspecies after them, add "'t" as a
         possible author prefix, add "emend." as "emendatum or rectified by" to
         authors.

3.4.4 -- support "del" as part of authorship, do not truncate epithets that
         start with "nomen", add "nvar." as a rank.

3.4.3 -- add "fil." as a possible spelling of "filius", add "do" as an author
         prefix, add "apud" as an author separator, add possible second "ex" or
         "in".

3.4.2 -- update treetop to 1.6. 

3.4.1 -- support for authors starting with "d'".

3.4.0 -- added ScientificNameParser.add_rank_to_canonical(parsed) method.
         This method allows to add infraspecific rank to a canonical form
         after the fact of parsing.

3.3.0 -- parserver gets new option -- -H for host, default 127.0.0.1.

3.2.1 -- fix parserver -- it does remove new lines now (before it was not
         necessary as they were stripped in older versions by parser)
         necessary as they were stripped in older versions by parser).

3.2.0 -- added UUID version 5 identifiers for every name string, better
         normalizing for the names with apostrophes, underscore-formatted
         names are supported. Verbatim field does mean nonchanged input now
         (before it was stripping empty spaces and new lines around name
         string). Minor version increase because of change in the output
         format ("id" field).

3.1.10 -- NPV viruses added.

3.1.9 -- more virus keywords, better handling of apostrophes in
         species epithets.

3.1.8 -- downgrading dependency on treetop to 1.4.1.

3.1.7 -- fixed travis and dependencies.

3.1.6 -- added forma. to ranks, tests for species epithets with apostrophe.

3.1.5 -- updated depenencies.

3.1.4 -- added files generated by tt to repository.

3.1.3 -- removed dependency on jeweler.

3.1.2 -- fixed problems with infraspecies epithets starting with fo,
for example Peristernia nassatula forskali Tapparone-Canefri 1875.

3.1.1 -- fixed problem with names ending on sp.

3.1.0 -- added surrogates: Genbank, Barcode of life names.
Also cf., sp. spp are flagged as surrogates.

3.0.1 -- updated gems.

3.0.0 -- removing support for ruby 1.8.7, making biodiversity gem be the same
as biodiversity19, deprecating biodiversity19. A few newly discovered bugs
are fixed.

2.1.0 -- added ScientificNameParser.version method.

2.0.0 -- backward incompatibe change in parserver, therefore new major number.
In parserver removed option --output=canonical_with_rank, instead added -r
option which allows to have canonical with rank with either json or canonical
outputs.

1.2.0 -- changed method invocation signature ScientificNameParser.new
Now it can take options.

1.1.3 -- added 'fo' as rank.

1.1.2  -- static method for fixins all-caps canonical names, fixing caps
for authors words, ampersand instead of 'et' in normalization.

1.1.1  -- more multi-uninomials cases, expanded viruses detection, added
abbreviated genera and a few small fixes.

1.1.0  -- added multi-uninomials, fixes in identification annotations (aff.,
cf., sp. etc), bug fixes, more robust salvage mode.

1.0.17 -- fixed a bug which prevented all diacritics be converted correctly.

1.0.16 -- dirty mode now converts ë to e.

1.0.15 -- additional rules added for names ending with ssp. sp sp. and cf.

1.0.14 -- canonical forms had allowed ë as a character until now. After this
version the only utf-8 character allowed in canonical forms should be the
multiplication sign for hybrids.

1.0.13 -- canonical forms for cf. aff. qualifiers are modified: canonical for
'Aus cf. bus' is now 'Aus bus'; canonical for 'Aus aff. bus' is now 'Aus'.
Ranks at the end of the name like 'var', 'ssp', 'spp' are considered junk and
are ignored.

1.0.12 -- bug is fixed which prevented 'Cucurbita pepo' be parsed correctly,
f., forma, fr. are now treated as any other ranks.
