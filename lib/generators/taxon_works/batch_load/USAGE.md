# Description

Stubs out the basic needed files for a new TaxonWorks batch loader 

# Example

```ruby
    rails generate taxonworks:batch_load Otu batch_loader_name
```

Where 
* `model_name` = `Otu`
* `batch_loader_name` = `batch_loader_name` 
    
The result of this command will be:
```      
    create  lib/batch_load/import/otus/batch_loader_name_interpreter.rb
    route  # routes added to otus by batch_load generator
     resource :otus do
       collection do
         get :preview_batch_loader_name_batch_load
         post :create_batch_loader_name_batch_load
       end
     end

     create/skip  app/views/otus/batch_load.html.erb
     append  app/views/otus/batch_load.html.erb
     create  app/views/otus/batch_load/batch_loader_name/_batch_load.html.erb
     create  app/views/otus/batch_load/batch_loader_name/_form.html.erb
     create  app/views/otus/batch_load/batch_loader_name/create.html.erb
     create  app/views/otus/batch_load/batch_loader_name/preview.html.erb
     insert  app/controllers/otus_controller.rb
```

The batch loader should be stubbed and immediately visible under the respective model.
Batch loaders reference interpreters in lib/batchload/import/.  Interpreters inherit
from lib/import. 

After running this generate the next steps are typrically to:
1) Describe the batch loader to the user in `_batch_load.html.erb` 
2) Provide additional user-provided parameters in `_form.html`
3) Tweak `create.html.erb` and `preview.html.erb` to provide a response specific to this batch load
4) Write tests and code the interpreter
