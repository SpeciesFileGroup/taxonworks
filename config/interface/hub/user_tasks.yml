# Valid attributes (* required)
#
#   name* - a friendly human readable name describing the task
#   description - a sentence or two further defining what the task will do for the user
#   related_prefixes - an array members must be route prefixes and may include user tasks or data prefixes
#   hub - true if this tasks should appear at the hub, these tasks MAY NOT require parameters
#   categories - an array of one ore more of [CollectingEvent, CollectionObject, Source, TaxonName]
#   status - one of [complete, stable, prototype,  unknown (default) ]
#               complete: users can expect the interfaces to remain in their present form
#               stable: primary elements are complete, but minor changes (CSS, feedback etc.) may change
#               prototype: while production ready, anything can change
#               uknown: task has not been classifed
