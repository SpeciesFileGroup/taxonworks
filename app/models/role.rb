# A Role relates a Person or an Organization to other data. Both People and Organizations are "data" in TaxonWorks.
# Every Role can reference a Person, a few can reference an Organization.
#
# Roles are the only place where person_id and organization_id must be referenced.

# Had we started from scratch we might have implemented a polymorphic `role_agent`,
# though we reference people *far* more often than organziations, so it would
# have felt klunky to always de-reference to role_agent.
#
# @!attribute person_id
#   @return [Integer]
#    The ID of the Person in the role.
#
# @!attribute organization_id
#   @return [Integer]
#    The ID of the Organization in the role.
#
# @!attribute type
#   @return [String]
#    The type (subclass) of the role, e.g. TaxonDeterminer.
#
# @!attribute role_object_id
#   @return [Integer]
#     The id of the object the role is bound to.
#
# @!attribute role_object_type
#   @return [String]
#     THe class of the object the role is bound to.
#
# @!attribute position
#   @return [Integer]
#     Sort order.
#
# @!attribute project_id
#   @return [Integer]
#   the project ID
