# A Darwin Core Record for the Occurrence core.  Field generated from Ruby dwc-meta, which references
# the same spec that is used in the IPT, and the Dwc Assistant.  Each record
# references a specific CollectionObject or AssertedDistribution.
#
# Important: This is a cache/index, data here are periodically destroyed and regenerated from multiple tables in TW.
#
# DWC attributes are camelCase to facilitate matching
# dwcClass is a replacement for the Rails reserved 'Class'
#
# All DC attributes (attributes not in DwcOccurrence::TW_ATTRIBUTES) in this table are namespaced to dc ("http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/")
#
# README:
#   There is a two part strategy to building the index. 1) An individual record will rebuild on request with `parameter to collection_objects/123/dwc*?build=true`.
#   2) Wipe, and rebuild on some schedule. It would in theory be possible to track and rebuild when a class of every property was created (or updated), however
#   this is a lot of overhead to inject/code for a lot of models. It would inject latency at numerous stages that would perhaps impact UI performance.
#
#  Notes -
#
#  This experiment isn't going to work at scale, too many preceding calls for big returns

#    We know collection object is definitely 1:1 with PreservedSpecimen, however

#    its a published record.  Seems we need a 'PublishedAssertation', just like we model the data.
