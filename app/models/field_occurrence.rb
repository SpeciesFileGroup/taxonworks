# A FieldOccurrence is
#   * A TaxonDetermination
#   * Done in the field (As defined by the CollectingEvent)
#
# It is differentiated from a CollectionObject by:
#   * No physical individual is brought back to a physical collection.
#   * It requires a TaxonDetermination be present
#   * It is not Containable (or Loanable, etc.)
#
# @!attribute total
#   @return [Integer]
#    The enumerated number of things observed in the field, as asserted by *the collector* of a CollectingEvent.  Must be zero if is_absent = true.
#
# @!attribute is_absent
#   @return [Boolean]
#     a positive negative, when true then there exists an assertion that the taxon was not observed given the effort of the CollectingEvent.  Inessence a confirmation/checksum of total=0 assertions.
#     Total must be zero here.
