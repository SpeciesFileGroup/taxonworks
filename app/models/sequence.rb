require_dependency 'sequence_relationship'

# A DNA, RNA, or Amino Acid, as defined by a string of letters.
# All other attributes are stored in related tables, the overal model is basically a graph with nodes having attributes.
#
# @!attribute sequence
#   @return [String]
#     the letters representing the sequence
#
# @!attribute sequence_type
#   @return [String]
#     one of "DNA", "RNA", "AA"
#
# @!attribute name
#   @return [String]
#     the _asserted_ name for this sequence, typically the target gene name like "CO1".
#     Important! The preferred mechanism for assinging this type of label to a sequence is
#     assigning pertinent metadata (relationships to other sequences) and then
#     inferrning that those sequences with particular metadata have a
#     specific gene name (Descriptor::Gene#name).
