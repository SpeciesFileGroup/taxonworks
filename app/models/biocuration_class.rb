# A BiocurationClass is used with BiocurationClassification to organize a collection according to some biological categories (attributes).
# Biocuration classes help to answer the question "where might I find this in the collection."
#
# For example, in an insect collection, this may be things like "adult", "pupae", "male", "female".  More
# generally they could be categories like "skulls", "furs", or perhaps even "wet" or "dry".  It is important to note that
# these categorizations are for *organization* and *curatorial* purposes, they are not primary assertions that the collection object itself has
# the biological property "maleness", or "adultness".  That is, in most, but not all, cases we can _infer_ that the classification means that the collection object
# is a "male" or "adult".
