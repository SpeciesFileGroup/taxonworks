# An OriginRelationship asserts that one object is derived_from another.

# The old object is the source_of or origin_of the new object.
# The new object originates_from the old_object.

# Currently these combinations are planned (* not implemented):

# old_object / new_object

# * field_observation / collection_object
# collection_object / collection_object
# collection_object / extract
# * collection_object / part_of (anatomy)
# * part_of / part_of
# * part_of / extract
# extract / extract
# extract / sequence
# sequence / sequence
