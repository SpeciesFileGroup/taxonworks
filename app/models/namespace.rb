# A Namespace is used to define a set of local Identifiers.
# All identifiers within a Namespace must be unique.
# Namespaces are shared across projects.
# In TaxonWorks Identifiers + Namespaces are used for differentiating/disambiguating one datum from another.
# This applies to all local identifiers, not just what most might be familiar with in the
# DwC catalogNumber field.
#
# Namespaces are used to to meet practical needs that also have FAIR consequences:
# * They attempt to provide a degree of provenance as to how the Identifier came to be
# * To differentiate, in practical terms, one identifier from another within the system that merges data
# * To act as a labels (short mneomincs) that allows the data curator to disambiguate what might be otherwise two identical strings
##
# Namespaces are minted in TW on a first come first serve basis.  Their short and
# long names must be unique. When conflicts arise new values must be minted for
# record keeping purposes. In this case a verbatim_short_name can be provided, and this
# value will be presented for reporting/searching purposes.  This is a strong restriction
# that is intended to encourage users to think before they mint a Namespace.
#
# In TaxonWorks Namespaces _do not_ imply ownership of the things they are linked to.  If an identifier has a Namespace
# that includes a reference, in some way, to some Repository, it does not mean that that Repository 'owns' the identified thing.
#
# In natural history collection management many catalog numbers contain an institutional coden as
# part of their catalog number (as physically written).  In TaxonWorks we treat that coden as the basis
# for a Namespace. Note that we also may use the CODEN in a second way, to identify the Repository.
# While the string is duplicate the meaning is not.  One use let's us quickly reference a Repository,
# the second use let's us quickly narrow searches to a specific Identifier linked to our object.
#
# @!attribute institution
# @return [String]
#   The institution (loosely, could be a person) responsible for minting this Namespace.  Roughly, where to look for more information.
#   This is NOT 1:1 with http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/ownerInstitutionCode, which implies ownership. It is narrower in that
#   it means the institution or individual "owns", or minted this Namespace, that's all.
#
# @!attribute name
# @return [String]
#   The full, descriptive name of the namespace. For example 'Illinois Natural History Collection Insect Collection Identifiers'.
#
# @!attribute short_name
# @return [String]
#   A short, realized version of the name, as seen in the physical label if there is a physical form. For example "INHIC".
#   This may be embedded in http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/institutionCode.
#   We presently do not differentiate a http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/collectionCode in
#   identifiers, that data may(?) fall into Repositories.
#
# @!attribute verbatim_short_name
# @return [String]
#   TW enforces uniqueness of short names.  When a short name exists for historical reasons but it has already
#   been included in TW then a new short name must be minted, and a verbatim_short_name used to indicate the
#   physically/and or historically recorded value.
#
# @!attribute delimiter
# @return [String, nil]
#    Defines the character(s) to be placed between the namespace short name and the identifier
#
# @!attribute is_virtual
# @return [Boolean]
#   Defaults to false. If true then the namespace short name is not part of the "physical" identifier. Required to handle identifiers incoming
# from DwC in some contexts.
