# A special purpose notes field that records the notes of someone observing one or more collection objects.
#
# Includes verbatim block of text (perhaps json too ultimately) that details observations on a collection object.
# Should only include notes on CollectionObjects, not field observations, i.e. this is a precursor of a
# CollectionObject instance.
#
# Example usages:
# 1) Recording notes metadata about a image that contains multiple slides or non-emunmarated collection objects
# 2) While working in a collection a user rapidly types all labels/metadata from a specimen into one field, and moves
#     on.  This data is later broken down into individual records
#
# @!attribute data
#   @return [String]
#   @todo
#
# @!attribute project_id
#   @return [Integer]
#   the project ID
